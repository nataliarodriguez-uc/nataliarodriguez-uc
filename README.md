### About my Interests

I am interested in machine learning, data science, and their growing range of real-world applications, particularly in fields like healthcare, engineering systems, and business operations. Even so, what excites me most is going beyond implementation: using optimization, mathematical modeling, and statistical learning to improve how intelligent systems are built and understood.

While my foundation is in operations research and machine learning, I am increasingly focused on how optimization helps us design smarter, more interpretable, and more efficient AI systems. Iâ€™m especially drawn to the theoretical contributions of machine learning, and how rigorous modeling can support advances in algorithmic performance and real-world impact. I'm currently learning more about AI structures through advances on my past and current project applications.

### About my Projects 

I currently have two main projects that I worked on during my undergraduate and graduate journey, which I have continued to build on since then. At UPR MayagÃ¼ez, my work centered on applying machine learning frameworks to improve survival prediction in pancreatic cancer, using feature selection techniques to enhance model performance. Later at UC Berkeley, I developed optimization methods to improve training efficiency in contrastive learning tasks, focusing on proximal and Newton-based approaches for AUC maximization.  

#### Current Role:
I recently completed a Computing Graduate Internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory through the Computing Scholar Program. My project focused on developing computationally efficient algorithms for global optimization of acquisition functions in Bayesian Optimization, particularly under high-dimensional, high-fidelity data settings. While the internship has formally concluded, I am continuing to advance this work by supporting and contributing to the projectâ€™s public repository, ensuring ongoing impact and broader accessibility of the research.
